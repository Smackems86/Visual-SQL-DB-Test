Visual ERP 2018 

As of 2018, the project to stabalize and introduce stable changes to Visual's Database has been fragmented due to poorly organized material. The goal
here is to maintain a record of all changes to code and it's functionality. There are many funtions that SQL Studio incorporates this however none
as streamlined and organized as this platform


All changes to approved scripts and code must be approved.
